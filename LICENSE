I don't know much about legal stuff and I'm too lazy to read through all the licences and choose the right one but basicaly we will finish developing the plane and I will release it on flightsim.to for free.
You cannot post it as is but if you modify it DM ME BEFORE POSTING (For example if you change the CEO or something DM me before you post it.) and I will approve it or not. If I approve it, please give us credit for the base stuff on the post. My discord: Flight Sim Central#6235 If there is anything else not written here that you have a question about, please DM me it'll be easier for me and you.
